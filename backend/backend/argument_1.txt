**Brenda**: Hey.

**Brandon**: Hey babe, how was your day?

**Brenda**: Oh, so now you care about my day?

**Brandon**: What's that supposed to mean?

**Brenda**: You seriously don't know what today is, do you?

**Brandon**: Um... Thursday?

**Brenda**: You fucking kidding me right now?

**Brandon**: Whoa, what's with the attitude?

**Brenda**: My attitude? MY ATTITUDE? It's my birthday, you asshole!

**Brandon**: Oh shit... Babe, I'm so sorry, I've been swamped at work and-

**Brenda**: Save it! You weren't too "swamped" to go golfing with Steve last weekend!

**Brandon**: That's not fair. I've had this huge project-

**Brenda**: Not fair? You know what's not fair? Being with someone for six years who can't remember your goddamn birthday!

**Brandon**: Come on, it was an honest mistake!

**Brenda**: A mistake? Like our whole relationship?

**Brandon**: Don't start with that dramatic bullshit.

**Brenda**: Oh, I'm being dramatic now? At least I remember important dates!

**Brandon**: Like you remembered our anniversary last year?

**Brenda**: That was different and you know it! I was dealing with my mom's cancer!

**Brandon**: Low blow bringing up the golf thing. You know I needed that break.

**Brenda**: And I needed my boyfriend to remember my fucking birthday!

**Brandon**: I'll make it up to you, okay?

**Brenda**: Like you made up forgetting Valentine's Day?

**Brandon**: Jesus Christ, are we really doing this? Bringing up old shit?

**Brenda**: It's not old shit when it's a pattern!

**Brandon**: You want to talk patterns? How about your constant nagging?

**Brenda**: Nagging? Is that what you call wanting basic fucking respect?

**Brandon**: There's more to respect than remembering dates!

**Brenda**: Yeah, like what? Mansplaining respect to me right now?

**Brandon**: Don't pull that feminist card bullshit with me.

**Brenda**: Oh my god, you're such an ass!

**Brandon**: And you're being a psycho right now!

**Brenda**: Don't you DARE call me psycho! 

**Brandon**: Well, stop acting like one!

**Brenda**: You know what? This is exactly why Sarah said I shouldn't date you.

**Brandon**: Oh, bringing up Sarah now? Your perpetually single friend who hates all men?

**Brenda**: Don't talk about my friends! At least they remember my birthday!

**Brandon**: Yeah, because they have nothing else going on in their lives!

**Brenda**: Unlike you, Mr. Important-Can't-Remember-Shit!

**Brandon**: I'm busting my ass at work to build a future for us!

**Brenda**: What future? The one where I'm always an afterthought?

**Brandon**: You're not an afterthought! You're just... exhausting sometimes!

**Brenda**: Exhausting? I'm exhausting because I want you to care?

**Brandon**: I DO care! You think I like fucking up?

**Brenda**: Could've fooled me! Even my ex remembered my birthday!

**Brandon**: Oh perfect, here comes the Mike comparison!

**Brenda**: Well, maybe I should've stayed with him!

**Brandon**: Real nice. Real fucking nice.

**Brenda**: At least he made an effort!

**Brandon**: Yeah, such an effort he cheated on you with your coworker!

**Brenda**: Fuck you! That was a low blow!

**Brandon**: Lower than comparing me to him?

**Brenda**: You're impossible!

**Brandon**: I'm impossible? Look in the mirror, princess!

**Brenda**: Don't call me princess, you condescending prick!

**Brandon**: Better than being a high-maintenance drama queen!

**Brenda**: High maintenance? Because I expect basic decency?

**Brandon**: No, because everything's a fucking crisis with you!

**Brenda**: Maybe because you keep creating crises!

**Brandon**: Oh yeah, I'm just the worst boyfriend ever, right?

**Brenda**: Your words, not mine!

**Brandon**: You know what? I need some air.

**Brenda**: Running away? Typical Brandon move!

**Brandon**: Better than staying here and being attacked!

**Brenda**: Go ahead, leave. You're good at that.

**Brandon**: Don't do that guilt trip shit.

**Brenda**: It's not a guilt trip if it's true!

**Brandon**: You want the truth? You're suffocating me!

**Brenda**: Well, don't let me hold you back!

**Brandon**: Maybe I won't!

**Brenda**: Fine! Leave! Happy fucking birthday to me!

**Brandon**: You're unbelievable.

**Brenda**: And you're an insensitive jerk!

**Brandon**: At least I don't keep score like you do!

**Brenda**: No, you just don't care enough to keep track!

**Brandon**: I can't win with you, can I?

**Brenda**: Winning would require trying!

**Brandon**: Twenty-eight years old and you still throw tantrums!

**Brenda**: Oh, NOW you remember my age!

**Brandon**: I'm out of here.

**Brenda**: Great! Don't hurry back!

**Brandon**: Don't worry, I won't!

**Brenda**: I hate you right now!

**Brandon**: Feeling's mutual, babe!

**Brenda**: And don't call me babe!

**Brandon**: Whatever!

**Brenda**: ASSHOLE!

**Brandon**: You know what? You're impossible to love sometimes!

**Brenda**: Better than being impossible to remember!

**Brandon**: I didn't forget YOU, I forgot a date!

**Brenda**: It's the same thing!

**Brandon**: No, it's really fucking not!

**Brenda**: Just go! Since you want to so bad!

**Brandon**: Fine! Happy birthday! There, I said it!

**Brenda**: Too late!

**Brandon**: Story of my life with you!

**Brenda**: GET OUT!

**Brandon**: GLADLY!
