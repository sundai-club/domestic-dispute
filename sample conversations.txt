Convo 1 - 
15/11/24, 08:30 - Sarah: I can’t believe you forgot our anniversary again, Mike.
15/11/24, 08:32 - Mike: I didn’t forget. I was just busy with work and didn’t have time to plan anything.
15/11/24, 08:33 - Sarah: That’s the same excuse you use every year. It’s like I don’t matter to you.
15/11/24, 08:35 - Mike: That’s not fair. I’ve been under a lot of pressure lately.
15/11/24, 08:36 - Sarah: So, work is more important than me? Good to know.
15/11/24, 08:38 - Mike: You know that’s not true. Why do you always make it such a big deal?
15/11/24, 08:40 - Sarah: Because it is a big deal to me! I just wanted one day where I felt special.
15/11/24, 08:41 - Mike: I’m sorry, okay? I’ll make it up to you.
15/11/24, 08:42 - Sarah: You always say that, but nothing ever changes.
15/11/24, 08:45 - Mike: I’ll prove it to you this time. Just give me a chance.
15/11/24, 08:46 - Sarah: We’ll see, Mike. But I’m really tired of this.

Convo 2 - 
15/11/24, 19:00 - Maya: You’re late again.
15/11/24, 19:01 - Rahul: It’s just 10 minutes. What’s the big deal?
15/11/24, 19:02 - Maya: The big deal is that you’re always late, Rahul. It feels like my time doesn’t matter to you.
15/11/24, 19:03 - Rahul: I was stuck in traffic. You know I can’t control that.
15/11/24, 19:04 - Maya: You could leave earlier. But you never do.
15/11/24, 19:06 - Rahul: It’s not like I’m doing it on purpose. You’re blowing this out of proportion.
15/11/24, 19:07 - Maya: It’s not just today. It’s every date, every meeting. I’m tired of waiting for you all the time.
15/11/24, 19:08 - Rahul: You’re making me feel like a villain for something minor.
15/11/24, 19:09 - Maya: Minor? It makes me feel unimportant, like I’m not a priority.
15/11/24, 19:11 - Rahul: I’m sorry, okay? I’ll try harder next time.
15/11/24, 19:12 - Maya: You’ve said that before. Words don’t mean much without action.
15/11/24, 19:13 - Rahul: What do you want me to do then?
15/11/24, 19:14 - Maya: Show up on time. It’s not that complicated.
15/11/24, 19:15 - Rahul: I’ll set reminders if that helps.
15/11/24, 19:16 - Maya: I hope so. Because I’m done feeling like an afterthought.

Convo 3 - 
15/11/24, 18:10 - Jessica: You keep interrupting me whenever I try to talk.
15/11/24, 18:11 - Daniel: That’s not true. I’m just trying to explain myself.
15/11/24, 18:12 - Jessica: No, you’re trying to win the argument without actually listening.
15/11/24, 18:13 - Daniel: I do listen, Jess. You’re just being overly dramatic.
15/11/24, 18:14 - Jessica: See? There you go dismissing me again.
15/11/24, 18:15 - Daniel: I’m not dismissing you. I just think you’re making this bigger than it is.
15/11/24, 18:16 - Jessica: And you don’t think that’s part of the problem?
15/11/24, 18:17 - Daniel: Okay, maybe I cut you off sometimes, but it’s not intentional.
15/11/24, 18:18 - Jessica: It doesn’t matter if it’s intentional or not. It makes me feel like my words don’t matter.
15/11/24, 18:20 - Daniel: That’s not what I mean to do at all.
15/11/24, 18:21 - Jessica: Then stop doing it. Let me finish my thoughts before you jump in.
15/11/24, 18:22 - Daniel: I’ll try, but sometimes I just feel like I need to clarify things right away.
15/11/24, 18:23 - Jessica: Can’t you see that your need to clarify comes at the expense of me feeling heard?
15/11/24, 18:25 - Daniel: You’re right. I need to work on that.
15/11/24, 18:26 - Jessica: It’s not just about acknowledging it, Daniel. I need you to actually change.
15/11/24, 18:27 - Daniel: I will. I don’t want you to feel this way.
15/11/24, 18:28 - Jessica: Good. Because I can’t keep having the same argument over and over.
15/11/24, 18:30 - Daniel: I promise I’ll do better.

Convo 4 - 
16/11/24, 20:00 - Aisha: You never ask me how I’m really feeling.
16/11/24, 20:01 - Raj: That’s not true. I ask you about your day all the time.
16/11/24, 20:02 - Aisha: Asking about my day isn’t the same as caring about my emotions.
16/11/24, 20:03 - Raj: I care about your emotions! Why would you think I don’t?
16/11/24, 20:04 - Aisha: Because when I try to open up, you either change the subject or brush it off.
16/11/24, 20:06 - Raj: That’s not brushing it off. I’m just trying to keep things light.
16/11/24, 20:07 - Aisha: But I don’t always want “light,” Raj. Sometimes I need you to take me seriously.
16/11/24, 20:08 - Raj: Okay, I get it. I’ll try to be more attentive.
16/11/24, 20:09 - Aisha: “I’ll try” isn’t enough. I need you to actually do it.
16/11/24, 20:11 - Raj: So, what do you want me to do when you’re feeling down?
16/11/24, 20:12 - Aisha: Listen. Ask questions. Don’t try to fix things unless I ask you to.
16/11/24, 20:13 - Raj: That sounds simple enough. I’ll do that.
16/11/24, 20:14 - Aisha: And don’t make it about you when I’m talking about me.
16/11/24, 20:15 - Raj: Do I really do that?
16/11/24, 20:16 - Aisha: Yes, and it makes me feel like I can’t even have my own moment.
16/11/24, 20:17 - Raj: I didn’t realize that. I’ll work on it.

Convo 5 - 
18/11/24, 14:01 - Maya: You didn’t even congratulate me on my promotion.
18/11/24, 14:03 - Arjun: I said “good job” yesterday. Isn’t that enough?
18/11/24, 14:04 - Maya: No, it’s not. It felt so dismissive, like it didn’t matter to you.
18/11/24, 14:05 - Arjun: I don’t see why you’re making such a big deal about it.
18/11/24, 14:06 - Maya: Because it is a big deal! I worked so hard for this, and you just brushed it off.
18/11/24, 14:07 - Arjun: I didn’t brush it off. I acknowledged it. What more do you want?
18/11/24, 14:08 - Maya: I want you to be proud of me, not act like it’s no big deal.
18/11/24, 14:09 - Arjun: I am proud of you! I just don’t feel the need to make a huge fuss.
18/11/24, 14:10 - Maya: Why is it so hard for you to celebrate my success?
18/11/24, 14:11 - Arjun: I don’t know, Maya. Maybe because you celebrate enough for both of us?
18/11/24, 14:12 - Maya: Wow. So now I’m the problem because I’m happy about my achievements?
18/11/24, 14:13 - Arjun: That’s not what I said. You’re twisting my words.
18/11/24, 14:14 - Maya: No, I’m pointing out how dismissive you’re being.
18/11/24, 14:15 - Arjun: Can’t we just move on? This is exhausting.
18/11/24, 14:16 - Maya: It’s exhausting for you to talk about my accomplishments?
18/11/24, 14:17 - Arjun: That’s not what I mean. I just don’t see why this has to turn into a fight.
18/11/24, 14:18 - Maya: It’s a fight because you don’t care enough to make it anything else.
18/11/24, 14:19 - Arjun: That’s unfair, and you know it.
18/11/24, 14:20 - Maya: What’s unfair is how little you seem to value me.
18/11/24, 14:21 - Arjun: You’re overreacting. I value you more than you think.
18/11/24, 14:22 - Maya: Saying that doesn’t mean anything if your actions don’t back it up.
18/11/24, 14:23 - Arjun: Why does everything I do have to be under a microscope?
18/11/24, 14:24 - Maya: Why do you think basic appreciation is too much to ask for?
18/11/24, 14:25 - Arjun: I don’t! I just don’t express it the way you want me to.
18/11/24, 14:26 - Maya: And you think that’s an excuse?
18/11/24, 14:27 - Arjun: I think it’s the truth.
18/11/24, 14:28 - Maya: The truth is, you only put in effort when it benefits you.
18/11/24, 14:29 - Arjun: That’s a low blow.
18/11/24, 14:30 - Maya: Is it? Name one time you’ve gone out of your way to support me.
18/11/24, 14:31 - Arjun: I support you all the time!
18/11/24, 14:32 - Maya: How? By saying “good job” like it’s a chore?
18/11/24, 14:33 - Arjun: You’re being unreasonable.
18/11/24, 14:34 - Maya: No, I’m asking for the bare minimum.
18/11/24, 14:35 - Arjun: This is going nowhere.
18/11/24, 14:36 - Maya: It’s going nowhere because you refuse to acknowledge your part in this.
18/11/24, 14:37 - Arjun: Fine. I’m the bad guy. Happy now?
18/11/24, 14:38 - Maya: Stop being sarcastic and take some responsibility for once.
18/11/24, 14:39 - Arjun: Responsibility for what? For not throwing a parade?
18/11/24, 14:40 - Maya: For being emotionally unavailable when I need you.
18/11/24, 14:41 - Arjun: That’s not fair.
18/11/24, 14:42 - Maya: What’s not fair is feeling like I have to beg for your support.
18/11/24, 14:43 - Arjun: I support you in my own way.
18/11/24, 14:44 - Maya: Your “own way” isn’t enough for a relationship.
18/11/24, 14:45 - Arjun: So now I’m just not good enough, huh?
18/11/24, 14:46 - Maya: If you keep shutting me out, what do you expect?
18/11/24, 14:47 - Arjun: I expect you to understand that I’m trying.
18/11/24, 14:48 - Maya: And I expect you to show it instead of just saying it.
18/11/24, 14:49 - Arjun: I’m done talking about this.
18/11/24, 14:50 - Maya: Of course you are. You’re always done when it’s about me.
